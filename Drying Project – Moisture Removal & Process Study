Problem I Took On

Goal: Study how to remove moisture from a material efficiently.

Focus: Drying kinetics, energy requirements, and process behavior.

Limited real data, so this is more of a first-cut, educational simulation/project.

⭐ 2. What I Wanted to Learn

How moisture content changes over time during drying.

How temperature, airflow, and surface area affect drying rate.

How to estimate energy consumption for drying.

Understand practical challenges in designing drying systems.

⭐ 3. How I Approached It

Chose a sample material with known moisture content.

Simulated drying process using basic equations & assumptions.

Calculated:

Drying rate

Moisture removal over time

Energy required

Tested different conditions: temperature, air velocity, and material thickness.

⭐ 4. What I Learned / Solved

Drying rate depends heavily on temperature and airflow.

Surface area and thickness affect how fast moisture leaves the material.

Could plot moisture content vs time curves to visualize drying behavior.

Learned rough energy requirement estimates for practical design.

Created a simplified process diagram showing airflow, heater, and material flow.

⭐ 5. Experiments / Tweaks I Tried

Increased temperature → faster drying but higher energy.

Increased airflow → improved drying uniformity.

Changed material thickness → showed how thicker layers slow moisture removal.

Observed how small adjustments can significantly change drying time.

⭐ 6. Results (High-Level Impressions)

Produced drying curves for multiple conditions.

Estimated energy consumption for basic dryer design.

Created a simple PFD/flow diagram of the drying setup.

Gained hands-on understanding of drying behavior and process sensitivity.

⭐ 7. Status of Design

⚠️ Rudimentary / educational project — not ready for industrial use.

Provides:

Insight into drying kinetics

Basic energy estimation

Understanding of airflow and temperature effects

Needs:

Detailed experimental data

Advanced simulation for industrial-scale design

Safety & operational considerations
