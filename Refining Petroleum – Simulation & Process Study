What I Took On
Took a crack at simulating crude separation — think: gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and heavy oils.
Goal: understand how a refinery actually splits crude into fractions.
Data was sparse, so it’s more of a learning playground than a “ready-for-plant” design.

--> What was to be Learned
How temperature, pressure, and column design affect outputs.
How fraction yields change with operating conditions.
How to use a simulation tool (Aspen Plus) to model refining units.

Basically, get my hands dirty without breaking a refinery 😅.

--> How I Went About It
Set up a simple crude feed (approximate composition).
Modeled an atmospheric distillation column as the first step.

Defined key inputs:
Feed flow & temperature
Number of stages
Reflux ratio
Condenser & reboiler setup

Ran simulations, observed outputs, and tweaked variables to see what happens.

--> What was Figured Out
Could separate crude into approximate fractions (yay!)
Learned how sensitive yields are to reflux, temperature, and stage numbers.
Generated a first-cut PFD with main streams and product fractions.
Got a feeling for energy requirements and column behavior.

---> Experiments Tweaks 
Increased/decreased reflux → watched purity vs energy trade-off.
Adjusted number of trays → separation improved (me dancinnnnnng😄).
Played with cut points to see how fraction yields change.

Tweaked feed stage positions → saw differences in fraction separation.

---> Results (First Impressions)
Fraction yields looked reasonable for a preliminary study.
Energy estimates for condenser & reboiler were not too crazy.
Created stream summaries and material balance sheets.

Learned how small changes can make big differences in product composition.

---> Status of Design
This is a rudimentary / educational project — not ready for real refinery use.

Gives:
Hands-on understanding of crude fractionation
Insight into column operation & energy needs
First step for more detailed refinery design

Needs:
Real crude data & properties
Detailed thermodynamic modelling
Safety, controls, and operational validation
