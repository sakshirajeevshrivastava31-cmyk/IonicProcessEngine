What I Took On

Took a crack at simulating crude separation — think: gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and heavy oils.

Goal: understand how a refinery actually splits crude into fractions.

Data was sparse, so it’s more of a learning playground than a “ready-for-plant” design.

⭐ 2. What I Wanted to Learn

How temperature, pressure, and column design affect outputs.

How fraction yields change with operating conditions.

How to use a simulation tool (Aspen Plus/others) to model refining units.

Basically, get my hands dirty without breaking a refinery 😅.

⭐ 3. How I Went About It

Set up a simple crude feed (approximate composition).

Modeled an atmospheric distillation column as the first step.

Defined key inputs:

Feed flow & temperature

Number of stages

Reflux ratio

Condenser & reboiler setup

Ran simulations, observed outputs, and tweaked variables to see what happens.

⭐ 4. What I Figured Out

Could separate crude into approximate fractions (yay!)

Learned how sensitive yields are to reflux, temperature, and stage numbers.

Generated a first-cut PFD with main streams and product fractions.

Got a feeling for energy requirements and column behavior.

⭐ 5. Experiments & Tweaks I Did

Increased/decreased reflux → watched purity vs energy trade-off.

Adjusted number of trays → separation improved (some “aha!” moments 😄).

Played with cut points to see how fraction yields change.

Tweaked feed stage positions → saw differences in fraction separation.

⭐ 6. Results (First Impressions)

Fraction yields looked reasonable for a preliminary study.

Energy estimates for condenser & reboiler were not too crazy.

Created stream summaries and material balance sheets.

Learned how small changes can make big differences in product composition.

⭐ 7. Status of Design

⚠️ This is a rudimentary / educational project — not ready for real refinery use.

Gives:

Hands-on understanding of crude fractionation

Insight into column operation & energy needs

First step for more detailed refinery design

Needs:

Real crude data & properties

Detailed thermodynamic modelling

Safety, controls, and operational validation
