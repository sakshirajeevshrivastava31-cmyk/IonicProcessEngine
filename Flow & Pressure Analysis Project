Problem I Took On

Goal: Understand how fluids move through pipes and systems.

Focus: Pressure drops, flow rate, and behavior in simple piping setups.

Limited data, so this was more of a “play around and learn” project than a real plant-scale analysis.

⭐ 2. What I Wanted to Learn

How to calculate pressure drop in pipes using different methods.

How pipe diameter, length, and roughness affect flow.

Laminar vs turbulent flow behaviour.

How to apply theoretical equations to practical examples.

⭐ 3. How I Approached It

Took basic pipe networks with known fluid properties.

Calculated velocity, Reynolds number, and flow type.

Applied Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure drop.

Compared calculated vs observed/expected trends.

Adjusted parameters like pipe diameter, length, and fluid velocity to see their effect.

⭐ 4. What I Learned / Solved

Pressure drop increases with longer pipes or smaller diameter.

Flow regime changes when velocity or diameter changes — laminar vs turbulent.

Friction factor calculation is tricky but fun once you get it.

Could predict flow behavior reasonably well using simple models.

Created diagrams showing pressure drop vs flow rate trends.

⭐ 5. Experiments / Tweaks I Tried

Tested different pipe materials to see effect on roughness.

Changed fluid viscosity to simulate different liquids.

Adjusted flow rates to see impact on velocity and pressure drop.

Learned how small changes can make big differences in results.

⭐ 6. Results (High-Level Impressions)

Got clear pressure vs flow graphs for different scenarios.

Confirmed how pipe diameter & length dominate pressure drop.

Created a visual flow summary for each scenario.

Learned the importance of calculations before designing a real system.

⭐ 7. Status of Design

⚠️ Rudimentary / educational project — not for real plant use.

Gives:

Hands-on understanding of fluid mechanics principles

Insight into piping design considerations

First step towards advanced fluid system design

Needs:

More complex networks

Real fluid data and conditions

Detailed validation
